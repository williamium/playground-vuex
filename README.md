# Vue

This is just a simple test project I made for playing around with [Vue][] &amp; [Vuex][]. It's based on a very simple, stripped back booking system.

You'll need to have [json-server][] installed as I use that as fake back-end. The docs suggest installing it globally. Then you can run `npm run serve` to start the server & we'll now have a working back-end based on the contents of `db.json`.
